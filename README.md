# Deep Dive Using Java!

This is where I keep all my work from the course Data Structures & Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java. The course page can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java/) on Udemy. The course covers the following topics to varying degrees:
- Arrays 
- Sort Algorithms
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hashtables
- Seach Algorithms
- Trees
- Heaps
- Sets

**The course does not cover graphs or time and space complexity very well**. I have learned these topics from other resources but have chose to keep all of the work related to that learning here, as I consider it part of my journey to learn Data Structures & Algorithms well. I used many other resources as supplements to this course in addition to those I used to familiarize myself with topics not covered by the lectures. The list below is not meant to be comprehensive in any way. It contains many of these resources and acts solely as a reminder to myself.
