# Deep Dive Using Java!

This is where I keep all my work from the course Data Structures & Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java. The course page can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java/) on Udemy. The course covers the following topics to varying degrees:
- Arrays 
- Sort Algorithms
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hashtables
- Seach Algorithms
- Trees
- Heaps
- Sets

**The course does not cover graphs or time and space complexity very well**. I have learned these topics from other resources but have chose to keep all of the work related to that learning here, as I consider it part of my journey to learn Data Structures & Algorithms well. I used many other resources as supplements to this course in addition to those I used to familiarize myself with topics not covered by the lectures. The list below is not meant to be comprehensive in any way. It contains a few of these resources and acts solely as a reminder to myself.
